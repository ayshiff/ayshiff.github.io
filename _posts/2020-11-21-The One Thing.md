title: The One Thing 
---
  
As I said in my previous article, one of the ways to become more productive is to do one and **only** one thing at a time.

I will show you that this practice should not only apply to your work but also in your **everyday life**.

I you want more info about ***The One Thing*** book you can find them [here](https://www.the1thing.com/).

# To begin...

I will start by quoting the main question of this entire book ! The question that you should ask yourself every day.

*What's the **ONE Thing** you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary ?*

You need to find your **ONE Thing**.

# What did I take away from the book ?

I love to read books and **apply the lessons** I learned from them in my work and in my life.

Today I am going to explain to you how I apply the principles of this book to my work as a **softrware engineer**.

This article will be **shorter** than the previous ones as it has more the form of a **reminder**.
This article has no specific structure, it just lists some information that I found interesting in the form of **notes**.  

I hope you find them **helpful**.

# Let's begin

- **Follow** people that have already done what you want to achieve.     
If you can, **get mentored** by them.

- **Make habits**: it takes 66 days on average to build a new habit: [66-DAY CHALLENGE® CALENDAR](https://www.the1thing.com/resources/66-day-calendar/).

- **Domino effect**: all things have a small beginning, so **start small**.   

    You have to **align all your dominos** (tasks - goals) one behind the other, starting with the smallest.   
    
    By doing this you **reduce the effort** you would have to put in to bring down the last domino.   

    This technique also allows you to achieve **more important goals** than if you were trying to directly knock down the last domino.   

- **Manage your time** -> schedule what you will do in the day - week - month.

- Go large and then reduce to have your **One Thing**.

- Make fake **deadlines** to avoid procrastination.

- **Perseverance** != Long race -> **multiple smaller races**.

- Don't break the chain -> **Time blocking**.

- Don't be afraid to **fail**, this is how you **learn** best.

- **10 000 hours rule** -> Time block 4 hours each day for your **One thing**   .
    *What does it take to become an expert or master performer in a given field?    
    10,000 hours of practice.*

- Go behond the line of **"It's ok" - "Good job"**.   
It reminds me of the bar scene in the Whiplash movie:    
*There are no two words in the english language **more harmful** than "good job"*.

    In this scene, Fletcher, the ruthless conductor of a music school told his student about **the story of Charlie Parker** (nicknamed "Bird", he was an American jazz saxophonist).   
    Charlie Parker once played with drummer Jones who was **dissatisfied** by Parker's performance. **Ridiculed in public**, he told himself not to be mocked again.   

    He started practising and made a legendary performance.   

    This is what Fletcher said to his student:   

    *So, imagine if Jones had just said, “Well, that’s okay, Charlie. That was all right. Good job.” So Charlie thinks to himself, “Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job.” **End of story. No Bird.**     That to me is an absolute tragedy.*

- **Design** your path to reach your goals.

- Change your **attitude** ! "Accountable vs victim" -> don't be the passenger, take the **driver seat**.

- Say **no** to anything that is not your **One Thing**.

- You will face chaos in other areas of life, **be prepared**.

- Eat well and **excercise** often.

- **Surround** yourself with smart and nice people.

- **Clear your path** to success: find the **right environnement** to work.    

    Despite the quote from Albert Einstein:  *If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?*.   
    
    I think that having a **clean working environment** (sound - visual) avoids distractions and in my case is **more efficient** for my work.

- Your day start with a **single step**
