Productivity is one of the **most in-demand skill of today**.

But how can you become **more productive** ?

<br/>

# To begin...

Have you ever wondered how to become more productive at work ?  

Through this article I will try to share **my advices and tools to be more productive**.
Even if you have an expectional amount of work to do, you can remain **productive** and **relaxed**.
The purpose of this article is to become aware of your way of working, to question it and to try to **improve it**.   

The end goal is **to work smarter, not harder**.

# Focus on what really matters

In today's world, you are **drowning** in a lot of informations (emails, meetings...).   
You must filter the important ones from the distractions to focus on **what really matters**.   

This way you prioritize your time on the **most impactful tasks**.

</div>

## Design a plan to identify long-term priorities

**Plan everything** you need to do during the day / week.   

I like taking the analogy of the **jar theory**: start by filling your jar with the **rocks**, the big, important tasks, then you can add the **pebbles** which are the tasks with average importance and finally you can add the **sand** which represent the less important tasks.

<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">https://mindfulambition.net/big-rocks-first/</p>
</p>

This way you can **focus on your main goals** for your day / week and then it **create space** for the pebble tasks and finally the sand tasks. This technique also makes it easier to **respect your plans** and **get things done**.

Each week, make sure you schedule 30 minutes and 10 minutes each day to design your plan.

## The Eisenhower matrix

This productivity tool lets you **focus your time and attention** on activities in accordance with their **importance**. This is called the *Eisenhower Matrix* (or time matrix).

The idea is pretty simple:

- You can represent the four quadrants like so:

<p align="center">
<img alt="time-matrix" src="/images/posts/time-matrix.png" width="500"/>
</p>

- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:red">top-left</span> quadrant includes important, urgent work that have to be **done the same day** (or tomorrow at the latest).
- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:orange">top-right</span> quadrant includes **important tasks that are not urgent** but sould be **scheduled**.
- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:green">bottom-left</span> quadrant is for the work that is **urgent but not important** and should be **delegated** to others.
- And <span style="font-size: bold;color:blue">finally the bottom-right</span> one is the time you **waste on pointless things.**

Ideally you should spend most of your time in the <span style="font-size: bold;color:red">top-left</span> quadrant as this is where there is the important work that needs to be done quickly. This is also a way to **focus on one task at a time.**    

In order to put a task in this quadrant you should put all your tasks on a **list** and go through them one by one using the *Pause-Clarify-Decide method*.   
Pause for a moment and think:   
   - *Will this task need immediate action ?*
   - *Is this task important ?* 

It should give you the answer to know in **which quadrant** to put this task.
This way all your tasks will be sorted according to their **importance** and **urgency**.

## The 80-20 rule

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="80-20" src="/images/posts/80-20.png"/>
</div>

Lets take an example, Microsoft discovered that by fixing the top **20%** of the most-reported issues, **80%** of the related errors would be eliminated.   
It was also discovered that in general **80% of the results** will come from **20% of the efforts**.     
In other words, **80%** of the software you are writing can be written in **20%** of the total allocated time.

In conclusion, find **the most important 20%** of your work and **focus on it**.

<br/>

## Break you work into smaller pieces
Did you ever think that you were going to put off your work until tomorrow ?   
This is called **procrastination**.   
One reason why you are procrastinating is that your to-do list contains **too big** tasks.

<div class="image_container">
<img alt="pieces" src="/images/posts/pieces.jpg" class="image_cover"/>
</div>


By **breaking large tasks into smaller ones** you set more **short-term goals** that gives you the feeling of **moving forward** and it also gives you more **motivation**.

<br/>

## Get to work

Have you ever felt **without any motivation** to work?

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="work" src="/images/posts/work.jpg"/>
</div>

This feeling is quite normal ! Usually **motivation comes after productivity**.   
It's the same problem writers have with the *"blank page syndrome"*.   
Start by **doing something**, anything, cut your work into small pieces and **start** with a small task, just to get into the **"work" mode**.

<br/>

## Do one thing at a time

People are **bad at multitasking**. ([What research shows](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask))   

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="piece" src="/images/posts/piece.jpg"/>
</div>

The reason is pretty simple, most of the time your are **not** doing multiple things at once, you are just quickly switching your focus between things. It means that each time you switch your focus, you need to **re-focus** on the previous task.

# Organize your time

Dealing with time could be a hard task but if you apply the **correct time management techniques** and tips it can help you get **more organized** and consequently increase your productivity.   

Working on managing your time is the key to **take control** of your work.

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="time" src="/images/posts/time.jpg"/>
</div>

## The Pomodoro technique

This technique is used by **over 2 million people** to manage their time. 

The objective is to **alternate** focused **work sessions** with **frequent short breaks** which allows a regular **concentration** and prevent the brain from **getting tired**.

The idea is again pretty simple:

- **Choose a task** you’d like to do
- Set a timer for **25 minutes**
- **Work** on the task until the timer ends
- Take a **short break** (~5 minutes)
- Every **4 timer**, you can take a **longer break** (~25 minutes)

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" src="/images/posts/pomodoro.png"/>
<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">https://blog.hotmart.com/en/pomodoro-technique/</p>
</div>

You can also go further by making the Pomodoro technique more effective:

- Try to **estimate** how much your activities requires (effort + time)
- Efficiently **splits** a task into multiple sub-tasks

In **conclusion**, the Pomodoro technique helps you:

- Handle **interruptions** (social media…)
- **Estimate** more easily the time that a task will take to perform
- **Reduce the complexity** of your long-term goals
- Make your job more **motivating** by setting short-term goals

<br/>

## Take deliberate breaks

The technique seen above will helps you take **deliberate** breaks.   

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="break" src="/images/posts/break.jpg"/>
</div>

By "deliberate" I mean that people often take breaks to justify that they are **distracted**. It means that their breaks were **not scheduled** and it's possible that they are taking too much of them (or too long).   

To get the full benefit of a break, you must **disconnect** from what you were doing. For example, to disconnect from your work, you can **stand up from your desk** and go for a **walk**.   

This is a good way to **detach** your mind and your body from "work mode".

<br/>

## Handle your energy

Organizing your time is also a way to organize effectively your **energy**.   

Have you ever been stuck with a problem at the end of the day ? And usually you can figure it out the **next morning**...   
In fact you should be better doing **certain tasks** at **certain times in the day**.   
You can then determine which task **suits the best** for each time of day.

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="energy1" src="/images/posts/energy1.jpg"/>
</div>

Productive people know how to manage their energy to handle **the most difficult** tasks while they have **enough energy** to handle them.   
Remember that you have **less attention** than time during the day.

# Build your technology radar

This technique is a little bit off topic as it is not a direct way to get more productive but it is something that you should care **upstream** to spend time learning the things that will have a **real impact in your work**.

This radar contains four levels of concern:

- **Adopt**: **Strong recommendatio**n for adoption
- **Trial**: **Try** this out on projects that can handle the risk
- **Assess**: **Explore** to understand how it might affect you
- **Hold**: It doesn't matter

<p align="center">
<img alt="tech-radar" src="/images/posts/tech-radar.png" width="500"/>
<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks</p>
</p>

For example, as a frontend developer, you could have **adopted** React, whereas ReasonML is worth **trialing** on projects.
Machine Learning doesn’t impact you yet so you can **assess** it.
Finally you could have decided to **hold off** looking at Cloud Computing.

Each level of concern implies a **more or less** important **investment** on your part.
For the Assess level you could just read a weekly « overview » of the subject.
The trial level implies you to read more articles, try on projects… **Get your hands dirty** ! (You could have a sandbox workspace where you put all your experiment projects)    
For the Adopt level you should be more than familiar with the technology, this is your your **main expertise** !

In conclusion, the technology radar allows you to **organize your work** in a **hierarchical** manner in order to put those with the **most impact** first.   
This way you can focus on what really **matters**.

# Take care of you

This advice may seem logical but you should take care of your **body** and **mind**.   
All the tips I gave you above are useless if you don’t take care of your body.

<div class="image_container">
<img class="image_cover" alt="take_care" src="/images/posts/take_care.jpg"/>
</div>

For example, your brain consumes **20 percent of your energy** but it only takes up **2 percent of your body**.
If you don’t have enough energy to feed your brain it's a bit like having a **car without gasoline**…

So remember to take care of yourself by **doing exercice**, getting enough **sleep** and staying **healthy** !

# Conclusion

I understand that these tips don't work for everyone but they **worked for me** so why don't you too ?   
In addition, I only wrote about **certain techniques and tips** but there are **many others** that you can learn.

To sum up, here is how to be **more productive**:

- **Focus** on what really matters
- **Organize** your time
- **Build** your technology radar
- **Take care** of you
