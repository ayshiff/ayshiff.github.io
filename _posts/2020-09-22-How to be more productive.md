title: How can I become more productive at work ?
---

Have you ever wondered how to become more productive at work ?    
Productivity is one of the most in-demand skill of today.    
But How can you become more productive ?

Through this article I will try to share my advices and tools to be more productive.
The purpose of this article is to become aware of your way of working, to question it and to try to improve it.    
The end goal is **to work smarter, not harder**.

# To begin...

Even if you have a phenomenal amount of work to do, you can remain relaxed, productive and in control.

1. List all the tasks you have to accomplish no matter how small, and put them into a cohesive system that you can trust.
   This way, they will no longer take up your mind.

2. Make decisions without delay about any new tasks that come your way.
   In this way, you will have a framework allowing you to orient your future actions.

# The Pomodoro technique (time)

This technique is used by over 2 million people to manage their time.

The idea is pretty simple:

- Choose a task you’d like to do
- Set a timer for 25 minutes
- Work on the task until the timer ends
- Take a short break (~5 minutes)
- Every 4 timer, you can take a longer break (~25 minutes)

You can also go further by making the Pomodoro technique more effective:

- Try to estimate how much your activities requires (effort + time)
- Efficiently splits a task into multiple sub-tasks

In conclusion, the Pomodoro technique helps you:

- Handle interruptions (social media…)
- Estimate more easily the time that a task will take to perform
- Reduce the complexity of your long-term goals
- Make your job more motivating by setting short-term goals

# Focus on what really matters

This productivity tool lets you focus your time and attention on activities in accordance with their importance. This is called a *Time Matrix*.

The idea is again pretty simple:

- You can represent the four quadrants like so:

<p align="center">
<img alt="time-matrix" src="/images/posts/time-matrix.png" width="500"/>
</p>

- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:red">top-left one (Q1)</span> quadrant includes **important, urgent work.**
- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:orange">top-right one (Q2)</span> quadrant includes **important tasks that are not urgent.**
- The <span style="font-size: bold;color:green">bottom-left one (Q3)</span> quadrant time is for the work that is **urgent but not important.**
- And <span style="font-size: bold;color:blue">finally the bottom-right (Q4)</span> one is the time you **waste on pointless things.**

Ideally you should spend most of your time in Q2 as this where we can focus and think instead of reacting of the urgency of the tasks. This is also a way to focus on one task at a time.
In order to put a task in this quadrant you should use the *Pause-Clarify-Decide method* by pausing for a moment and thinking: *Will this task need immediate action ?* If the answer is no, you can focus on something else.

# Design a plan

Plan everything you need to do during the day/week.   
I like taking the analogy of the jar theory: start by filling your jar with the **rocks**, the big, important tasks, then you can add the **pebbles** which are the tasks with average importance and finally you can add the **sand** which represent the less important tasks.

<p align="center">
<img alt="life-jar" src="/images/posts/life-jar.png" width="500"/>
<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">https://mindfulambition.net/big-rocks-first/</p>
</p>

This way you can focus on your main goals for your day / week and then it create space for the pebble tasks and finally the sand tasks. This technique also makes it easier to respect your plans and get things done.

Each week, make sure you schedule 30 minutes and 10 minutes each day to design your plan.

# Build your technology radar (concern)

This technique is a little bit off topic as it is not a direct way to get more productive but something that you should care upstream to spend time learning the thing you should learn.

This radar contains four levels of concern:

- **Adopt**: Strong recommendation for adoption
- **Trial**: Try this out on projects that can handle the risk
- **Assess**: Explore to understand how it might affect you
- **Hold**: Don’t bother

<p align="center">
<img alt="tech-radar" src="/images/posts/tech-radar.png" width="500"/>
<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks</p>
</p>

For example, as a frontend developer, you could have strongly **adopted** React, whereas ReasonML is worth **trialing** on projects.
Machine Learning doesn’t impact you yet so you can **assess** it.
Finally you could have decided to **hold off** looking at Cloud Computing.

Each level of concern implies a more or less important investment on your part.
For the Assess level you could just read a weekly « overview » of the subject.
The trial level implies you to read more articles, try on projects… Get your hands dirty !
For the Adopt level you should be more than familiar with the technology, this is your your main expertise !

In conclusion, the technology radar allows you to organize your work in a hierarchical manner in order to put those with the most impact first.
This way you can focus on what really matters.

# Take care of you

This advice may seem logical but you should take care of your body and mind.All the tips I gave you above are useless if you don’t take care of your body.
For example, your brain consumes 20 percent of your energy bit it only takes up 2 percent of your body.
If you don’t have enough energy to feed your brain it's a bit like having a car without gasoline…

So remember to take care of you by doing exercice, getting enough sleep and staying healthy !
